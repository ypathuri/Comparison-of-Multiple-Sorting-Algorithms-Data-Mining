# Execution-and-Comparison-of-Multiple-Sorting-Algorithms
We have compared Merge sort, Quick sort, Bubble sort and Shell sort. 
Each Algorithm was tested to sort a list of cities in ascending order, list size 14 and list size 385.
We found that shell sort ran the fastest while the Merge sort was the slowest in the list of size 14. 
In the list of length 385, quick sort was the fastest while the Bubble sort was the slowest. 
We observed that the Bubble sort runtime increases as the size increaeses. 
Merge sort is consistent and perfomrs well regardless of the size overall.
